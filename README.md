# Erin Grover
Software Engineering Student @ Academy of Art University

I'm an up-and-coming game developer set to graduate in May of 2022, just a few months away!

# About Me

Living in the hot state of Arizona, I'm the father of a wonderful little guy named Tomasi, and husband to my beautiful wife Rosemarie. I am a massive motorsports fan, and the only other career I would pursue outside of game programming is probably driving for a Formula 1 team. Since I have yet to be recognised for my driving ability, I sooth that urge by building and driving a gocart around the yard with my son. When I'm not doing that I'm either catching up on my gaming backlog or playing boardgames with my wife.

# Current Projects (Screenshots coming soon!)
- [Exelius - The C++ Game Engine](https://github.com/GroverErin/ExeliusEngine) - This is my absolute favorite project. It's a 3 semester long project, currently about to begin the second semester.

# Past Projects (Screenshots coming soon!)
- [NoiseMap - The Perlin Noise Map Generator](https://github.com/GroverErin/ProceduralMapGenGame) - A close second to my above project, this is a perlin noise map generator that has a small minigame attached to it.
- [MallSim - Unreal Engine Utility Theory AI](https://github.com/GroverErin/UnrealMallSimulation) - My first in depth attempt at familiarizing myself with Unreal Engine 4. An amitious little project that aimed to replicate something like the Sims.
- [STEM Bingo - The Arduino Bingo Game](https://github.com/GroverErin) - This was my very first programming project, from before I was even in a programming degree. It's the project that sparked my love for programming, so it's very special to me in that respect. It's also terrible, so go easy on it. I'd love to try and recreate it again with the knowledge I have now. *Currently Not Linked, Sorry*
