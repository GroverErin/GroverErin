# Erin Grover
Software Engineering Student @ Academy of Art University

I'm an up-and-coming game developer set to graduate in May of 2022, just a few months away!

# About Me

Living in the hot state of Arizona, I'm the father of a wonderful little guy named Tomasi, and husband to my beautiful wife Rosemarie. I am a massive motorsports fan, and the only other career I would pursue outside of programming is probably driving for a Formula 1 team. Since I have yet to be recognised for my driving ability, I sooth that urge by building and driving a gocart around the yard with my son. When I'm not doing that I'm either camping, catching up on my gaming backlog, or playing boardgames with my wife.

# Experience

During Summer of 2021 I had the awesome opportunity to work with one of my instructors and mentors, David "Rez" Graham, at his game studio [Bleach Kitty Games](https://www.bleachkitty.com/BleachKittyGamesProjects/Journey/) on a project as a Gameplay Engineer. I spent a majority of my time working with the designers to create a series of quests, but I also spent a large portion of my time refactoring the inventory system in the game to reduce bugs and provide more clarity when using the system.

# Current Projects
- [Exelius - The C++ Game Engine](https://github.com/GroverErin/ExeliusEngine) - A simple 2D game engine. This is my absolute favorite project. It's a 3 semester long project, currently about to begin the second semester. It's still a bit rough, but the goal is to get all the features in while I still have help from my mentors.

# Past Projects
- [NoiseMap - The Perlin Noise Map Generator](https://github.com/GroverErin/ProceduralMapGenGame) - A close second to my above project as far as favoritism goes, this is a perlin noise map generator that has a small minigame attached to it. There are some other forms of procedural content as well, check out the readme for more info.
- [Loot Table Editor - Unity 3D Data Driven Custom Editor](https://github.com/GroverErin/UnityLootTableTool) - A Unity project with the goal of creating a Loot Table Editor that allows designers to create item drop tables quickly and easily, in a way that allows changes to be pushed to a CDN and not require costly game updates through an app store.
- [MallSim - Unreal Engine Utility Theory AI](https://github.com/GroverErin/UnrealMallSimulation) - My first in depth attempt at familiarizing myself with Unreal Engine 4. An ambitious little project that aimed to replicate something like the Sims, though, now that I've got a bit more experience, I'll probably go back and add some polish to it soon.
- [STEM Trivia - The Arduino Trivia Game](https://github.com/GroverErin/ArduinoLCDTrivia) - This was my very first programming project, from before I was even in a programming degree. It's the project that sparked my love for programming, so it's very special to me in that respect. It's also terrible, so go easy on it. I'd love to try and recreate it again with the knowledge I have now.
